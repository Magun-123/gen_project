# ðŸ§  NLP Document Analysis Agent

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for analyzing unstructured text documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It includes:

- Extraction of key entities (names, dates, locations, metrics, etc.)
- Automatic summarization of documents
- A conceptual agentic component to answer complex queries by chaining extraction and summarization
